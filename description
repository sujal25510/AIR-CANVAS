This Python script creates a virtual drawing application using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy. 
The application captures video from the webcam, detects hand landmarks to identify the forefinger's position, and uses this position to draw on a virtual canvas.
It includes multiple color options and the ability to clear the canvas.
